## Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
This project is a simple site to introduce the developer and to serve as a practice portfolio site.

## Motivation
This is a homework assignment to explore Bootstrap: rows, columns, HTML, and CSS.

## Tech/framework used
This was built using Bootstrap code (https://getbootstrap.com/) and Visual Studio Code software. Uploaded through GitHub.

## Features
There is a nav-bar, links, images, and a mailing form on the contact page. It is responsive, so the elements in the site shift with different size screens.
